## Single trait distribution
We're going to make some code chunks that explore single traits of penguins in a plot using ggplot

```{R}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```


```{R}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) 
  
```

```{R}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))
  
```
